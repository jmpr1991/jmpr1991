### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile, in where I am trying to develop different projects to enhance my coding skills, mainly in 
__python__, by applying the knowledge I am learning while studying __Artificial Intelligence__ and __Quantum Computing__ ðŸ’».

My background is in Physics and Aerospace Engineering. I am a passionate about new technologies with the willingness to 
always learn  something newðŸ“š. 

# Main projects

ðŸ¦  - [**Shor's algorithm**](https://github.com/jmpr1991/Shor_algorithm): this is a quantum algorithm which computes the 
prime factors of an integer. My implementation uses modular exponentiation.
ðŸ¦  - [**TSP problem optimization**](https://github.com/jmpr1991/TSP_problem): this is a Genetic Algorithm to solve 
the Travelling Salesman Problem.
ðŸ¦  - [**ES optimization**](https://github.com/jmpr1991/ES-Optimization): this is an Evolution Strategy to optimize different functions.
It can be easely adtaptable to the optimization of other functions.
