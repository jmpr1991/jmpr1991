### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile, in where I am trying to develop different projects to enhance my coding skills, mainly in 
__python__, by applying the knowledge I am learning while studying __Quantum Computing__ ðŸ’».

My background is in physics and aerospace engineering. I am a passionate about new technologies with the willingness to 
always learn  something newðŸ“š. 

# Main projects

ðŸ¦  - [**Shor's algorithm**](https://github.com/jmpr1991/Shor_algorithm): this is an algorithm which computes the prime
factors of an integer. My implementation uses modular exponentiation.
